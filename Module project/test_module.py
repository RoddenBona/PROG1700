#This is wht allows us to import other funccction into our own code
#When we import things like random and datetime. Those are just other python files
#That were made y other people being inported for us to just inject into our code


#As a simple example. we will define a greeting function to just say hello to us when something is inputed into "name"
def greeting(name):
    print(f"Hello there {name}")

#Now that the function is defined. We can import it into another one of our files
#Check the second test_module file for that in use
