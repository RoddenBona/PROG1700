#Creating a rectangle and define the attributes and methods of it to calculate it's area and perimeter

#define the class. classes are templates for objects
#n its's deffinition is the __init__ method which initializes it's attributes
#the self attribute is a reference to the instacne to the class. Every class needs it
#Length and width are attributes of the class
#We'll be calculating the area and perameter of the rectangle using a calculate_area and calculate_perimeter
