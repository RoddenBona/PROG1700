#Python sets lesson

#Used to store multiple items in a single variable much like lists, 
# except there is no ordered index, they're unchangeable, you can't have duplicates
# the only way to change an item in a set is to outright add or remove it

#Example

newset = {"Mario","Geno","Mallow"}
print(newset)
